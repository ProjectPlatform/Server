Tasks for Anthons in the server part:

The main target is to provide a small part of API, which will let clients to Get the User's profiles by their IDs
Now I work on this part on the client part - so any user structs will be finished tomorrow, I think

So the Task is next:
	User without authorization must be able to create the new profile and get its ID from the server
	Able to get all user Info with one request
	User must be able to get exactly necessary profile fields from the server in JSON
	User must be able to get count of objects in necessary field of necessary user
		For Example: how many Connected User 124821390 has?
	Able to change this fields
	All this info must be holded in the PostgreSQL
